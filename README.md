## 📋 Prerequisites

Before installing, you need:

1. **Home Assistant** running (any version)
2. **[HA Vibecode Agent](https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-cursor-agent)** v2.2.0+ installed as add-on
3. **Agent Key** from HA Vibecode Agent (auto-generated on first start)
4. **AI-enabled editor** installed (Cursor AI or VS Code + GitHub Copilot)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 0: Install Node.js (if not already installed)

The MCP server requires Node.js to run on your computer (where your AI editor is installed):

1. Check if Node.js is already installed: open terminal and run `node --version`
2. If not installed or version is below v18.0.0, download and install from **[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)**
3. After installation, verify: `node --version` should show v18.0.0 or higher
4. **Important:** Install Node.js on the computer where your AI editor runs, not on the Home Assistant server

### Step 1: Install HA Vibecode Agent

Install the agent in your Home Assistant:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store**
2. Click **⋮** → **Repositories**
3. Add: `https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-cursor-agent`
4. Install **HA Vibecode Agent** (v2.0.0+)
5. **Start** the agent

### Step 2: Setup MCP in Your AI Editor

**Get configuration from Home Assistant:**
1. Open your **Home Assistant** (usually http://homeassistant.local:8123)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **HA Vibecode Agent**
3. Click **"Open Web UI"** button

You'll see this interface with tabs for Cursor and VS Code + Copilot. Нажми на вкладку для Cursor или VS Code в зависимости от IDE в котором вы хотите работать с вашим Home Assistant и следуйте инструкциям, вам понадобится установить и настроить Cursor или VS Code чтобы они через MCP протокол могли взаимодействовать с агентом, который вы установили на борте Home Assistant.

Все готово, чтобы начать работать с вашими скриптами, автоматизациями и дашбордами Home Assistant с помощью AI.

Если вам нравится проект и вы хотите его развития, поставьте, пожалуйста, [GitHub Star](https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-cursor-agent) ⭐

### Step 3: Test Connection

**Verify everything works:**

Open your AI editor (Cursor or VS Code) and send this message to AI:
```
Connect to my Home Assistant and show me:
1. List of all my climate entities
2. Current status of the HA Vibecode Agent

This will verify the MCP connection is working.
```

If AI successfully returns your entities and agent status, you're all set! ✅

**Troubleshooting:** If connection fails:
- Check that HA Vibecode Agent is running
- Ensure your AI editor was fully restarted
- Verify configuration was pasted correctly

### Step 4: Start Building!

Just describe what you want in natural language - AI will handle the rest!

- Messages explain **what** changed and **why** (e.g., "Add automation: Control lights when motion detected")
- You can provide additional context via `description` parameter for even more clarity
- See [COMMIT_MESSAGES.md](./COMMIT_MESSAGES.md) for examples and best practices

```
Show me the last 10 changes to my configuration
```

**AI will:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Agent Key" error

1. Check your Agent Key is correct in `mcp.json` (under `HA_AGENT_KEY`)
2. Regenerate key if needed: Settings → Add-ons → HA Vibecode Agent → Open Web UI
3. Make sure HA Vibecode Agent is running
4. Verify agent is accessible: `curl http://homeassistant.local:8099/api/health`

### "Connection refused"

1. Check HA Vibecode Agent is started in Home Assistant
2. Verify the URL in `HA_AGENT_URL`
3. Make sure port 8099 is not blocked by firewall

### "spawn npx ENOENT" error

This error means Node.js is not installed or not found in your system PATH.

**Solution:** Install Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher) on the computer where Cursor is running:

1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Restart Cursor completely after installation
3. Verify installation by running `node --version` in a terminal

**Important:** Node.js must be installed on **your computer** (where Cursor runs), not on the Home Assistant server.

### Check Agent Logs

Ask Cursor AI:
```
Show me the agent logs
```

This will display what's happening in the agent.

---

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ All communication goes through HA Vibecode Agent (port 8099)
- ✅ Agent Key authentication for MCP clients
- ✅ Agent validates Agent Key for all requests
- ✅ Agent uses internal SUPERVISOR_TOKEN for Home Assistant API operations
- ✅ Your Agent Key is stored only in local Cursor config file
- ⚠️ **Never commit `mcp.json` with your Agent Key to git!**
