3. Add: `https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-cursor-agent`
4. Install **HA Cursor Agent** (v2.0.0+)
5. **Start** the agent

### Step 2: Setup MCP in Cursor

**Get configuration from Home Assistant:**
1. Open your **Home Assistant** (usually http://homeassistant.local:8123)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **HA Cursor Agent**
3. Click **"Open Web UI"** button
4. Click **"Copy Configuration to Clipboard"**
5. Configuration copied! ✅

**Add to Cursor AI:**
1. Open **Cursor** editor
2. Go to **Settings** (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
3. Click **Tools & MCP** in the sidebar
4. Click **New MCP Server**
5. Click **Add a Custom MCP Server**
6. **Paste** the configuration you copied
7. Click **Save**
8. **Restart Cursor** completely (Cmd/Ctrl + Q and reopen)

Done! Cursor AI is now connected to your Home Assistant 🎉

### Step 3: Test Connection

**Verify everything works:**

Open Cursor and send this message to AI:
```
Connect to my Home Assistant and show me:
1. List of all my climate entities
2. Current agent logs
3. Last 5 changes from Git history

This will verify the MCP connection is working.
```

If AI successfully returns your entities and Git history, you're all set! ✅

**Troubleshooting:** If connection fails:
- Check that HA Cursor Agent is running
- Ensure Cursor was fully restarted
- Verify configuration was pasted correctly

### Step 4: Start Building!

Just describe what you want in natural language - AI will handle the rest!

## 💬 Real-World Examples

Once configured, describe what you want in natural language. Cursor AI will analyze YOUR configuration and create tailored solutions:

### 🏗️ Install Complete Systems

```
Install a smart climate control system for my home. 
Analyze my TRV radiators, create automations for efficient 
heating with predictive shutdown, and set up a dashboard.
```

**AI will:**
- Detect your TRV entities
- Create 8-10 automations for smart heating
- Add helper entities for system state
- Create template sensors for monitoring
- Set up scripts for boiler control
- Generate Lovelace dashboard
- Test everything and deploy

```
Build a presence detection system using my phone trackers 
and create automations for lights, climate, and security.
```

**AI will:**
- Find your device_tracker entities
- Create zones and presence helpers
- Set up lighting automations per room
- Configure climate based on presence
- Add security notifications
- All tailored to YOUR devices!

### 🔧 Optimize Existing Systems

```
My heating system wastes energy. Analyze my current 
automations and optimize for efficiency while maintaining comfort.
```

**AI will:**
- Read current automations
- Analyze heating patterns
- Add predictive logic
- Implement adaptive cooldowns
- Keep your existing setup intact

### 🐛 Debug and Fix Issues

```
My bedroom lights automation isn't working properly. 
Check the logs, analyze the automation, and fix the issue.
```

**AI will:**
- Read automation configuration
- Check entity states
- Review agent logs for errors
- Identify the problem
- Fix and test the solution

### 📊 Monitor & Analyze System Behavior

**Cursor AI can read logs and analyze how your system actually works:**

```
Read the logs and analyze how my climate control system 
is performing. Is it working as expected?
```

**AI will:**
- Read Home Assistant logs
- Analyze automation triggers and actions
- Compare actual behavior vs. expected logic
- Identify deviations or inefficiencies

- Identify patterns (frequent on/off cycles, timing issues)
- Detect edge cases or unexpected behavior
- Calculate metrics (runtime, cycles, efficiency)
- Suggest specific optimizations

```
Monitor my automations and tell me if they're triggering 
too often or missing important events.
```

**AI will:**
- Track automation execution frequency
- Identify over-triggering or under-triggering

### 🎨 Create Custom Solutions

```
I want movie mode: dim all lights, close blinds, 
turn on TV and soundbar. Create scenes and automations.
```

**AI will:**
- Detect your lights, covers, media devices
- Create input_boolean for movie mode
- Build automation with all steps
- Add script for easy activation
- Customize based on YOUR devices

### 💾 Git Versioning & Rollback

**Every change is automatically backed up in Git!** You can view history and rollback anytime.

```
Show me the last 10 changes to my configuration
```

**AI will:**

```

**AI will:**
- Display detailed diff of that commit
- Explain what files were modified
- Help you understand the changes

**Available Git tools:**
- `ha_git_history` - View commit history (last 20 commits)
- `ha_git_diff` - Compare commits or see uncommitted changes
- `ha_git_rollback` - Restore to any previous version
- `ha_git_commit` - Manual backup with custom message

**Example workflow:**
1. Make changes → Automatically backed up ✅
2. Something breaks? → Ask AI to show history
3. AI shows commits → You identify good version
4. AI rolls back → Everything restored! 🎉
